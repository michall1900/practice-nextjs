# Next.js Dashboard App (Learning Project)

This repository reflects my learning process of **Next.js** by following the official tutorial:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Next.js Learn â€“ Dashboard App](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app)

## What I practiced
- Understanding the new **App Router** in Next.js 13+
- Creating and organizing **layouts** and **pages**
- Using **Server and Client Components**
- Navigation with `<Link>`, `useRouter`, and `usePathname`
- Styling with **Tailwind CSS** and conditional class handling
- Fetching data with the built-in `fetch()` and caching strategies
- Applying **dynamic routes** and route groups
- Working with the new **next/font** and metadata API
- Implementing patterns like **active links** in the sidebar

## Purpose
This project is not a production-ready app, but a **learning repository** that demonstrates core concepts of modern Next.js development.
